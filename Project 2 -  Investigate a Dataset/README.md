# Investigate a Movie Dataset
In this project, I go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. For this project I am using TMDb dataset and apply Data Analysis to figure out what exactly makes a movie a â€œsuccess".

With the growing demand of new movies and the wide range of movie genres, analytics about the performance of movies can give useful information to studios so that they can make the most strategic decisions regarding production and financing.
