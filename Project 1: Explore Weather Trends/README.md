# Explore Weather Trends
In this project, I analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends.

The goal of this project is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. 

To do this project, I follow the steps below:
1. Extract the data from udacity database by using SQL query.
   - SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
   - SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.
2. Open up the CSV in Python.
3. Create a line chart that compares city’s temperatures with the global temperatures.
4. Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and city’s averages, as well as overall trends. <br> 

Here are some questions:
 - Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
 - How do the changes in your city’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?
 - What does the overall trend look like? 
 - Is the world getting hotter or cooler? 
 - Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
